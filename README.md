**"Because Discipline is best enforced by a daemon with attitude."**

Idle Hands is a local monitoring and behavior-feedback system for productivity, self-regulation, and voluntary techno-masochism. It tracks your activity, enforces focus, and if properly integrated, can issue escalating punishments.

This is not your average productivity monitoring tool. It's a panopticon. And you're the inmate.

## Philosophy

Idle Hands isn't about "nudging."
It's about **punishing sloth.**
It's not "gamified productivity."
It's a **systematic behavioral correction protocol** wrapped in sass and fire.

> _"Motivation is unreliable. Discipline is engineered."_
